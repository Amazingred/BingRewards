Current version 2.3

2.3     *) bingQueriesGenerator - changed parsing HTML tag to comply with new Bing! output

        +) bingFlyoutParser + Reward.Action.PASS for 'Silver Status' and for 'Get the best of Bing by signing in with Facebook.' description
        +) bingRewards.printResults() now prints errors if verbose mode is off

2.1     +) main.py is now explicitly marked as a python script
        *) chmod 644 bingRewards.py
        *) chmod 755 main.py

2.0     +) Live authentication supported
        *) The script is now executed with
           python main.py
           See `python main.py -h` to understand how the script can be used
        *) Authentication configuration moved to config.xml. No direct script changes to use different account information are needed.
           config.xml accepts Live and Facebook authentication types. Any number of authentications can be added to config.xml.

1.4     Bing! rewards page changed. Bing! flyout is now requested with http://www.bing.com/rewards/dashboard in a Referer header, otherwise it is empty

1.3     Don't raise exception if history page is empty - warn instead.
        added to bingRewards.py:
        from __future__ import with_statement

1.2     Configurable salt to sleep between requests

1.1     Bing! news changed the output format for tag <span class="sn_snip">. This version works both with the former and the latter behavior

1.0     First implementation plus whatever was else before I created this file :)
