Current version 1.4

1.4     Bing! rewards page changed. Bing! flyout is now requested with http://www.bing.com/rewards/dashboard in a Referer header, otherwise it is empty

1.3     Don't raise exception if history page is empty - warn instead.
        added to bingRewards.py:
        from __future__ import with_statement

1.2     Configurable salt to sleep between requests

1.1     Bing! news changed the output format for tag <span class="sn_snip">. This version works both with the former and the latter behavior

1.0     First implementation plus whatever was else before I created this file :)
